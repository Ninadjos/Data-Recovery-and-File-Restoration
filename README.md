# Data-Recovery-and-File-Restoration
The goal of this mini cyber security project is to develop a file recovery and data restoration system that can help users retrieve crashed or deleted files from storage media, such as hard drives, USB drives, or memory cards. 

Title: Mini Cyber Security Project - File Recovery and Data Restoration

Project Components:
1. Research and Planning:
   - Conduct research on file recovery techniques and tools available.
   - Identify different file system types and their implications on data recovery.
   - Create a project plan outlining the steps to build the file recovery system and the technologies you'll use.

2. File Recovery Algorithm:
   - Develop an algorithm to scan the storage media for deleted or lost files.
   - Implement file signature-based recovery to identify file headers and footers to reconstruct deleted files.
   - Use various data carving techniques to extract data fragments and recover partially damaged files.

3. User Interface:
   - Create a user-friendly interface to interact with the file recovery system.
   - Allow users to select the target storage media for recovery.
   - Provide options to filter the search based on file types, creation date, or file name.s

4. Data Restoration:
   - Develop a mechanism to restore recovered files to a safe location to prevent overwriting or further data loss.
   - Implement a versioning system to keep track of multiple versions of recovered files.

5. Error Handling and Validation:
   - Incorporate error handling mechanisms to deal with read/write errors or corrupted data during the recovery process.
   - Validate the recovered files to ensure their integrity and prevent potential malware threats.

6. Testing and Evaluation:
   - Test the file recovery system using simulated crashed scenarios and deleted files.
   - Assess the efficiency and accuracy of the recovery process.
   - Analyze the success rate of file recovery under different circumstances.

7. Security Measures:
   - Implement security measures to protect recovered files and user data from unauthorized access.
   - Consider encryption techniques for storing sensitive files to maintain confidentiality.

8. Documentation and Reporting:
   - Document the project's architecture, algorithms, and implementation details.
   - Prepare a user manual to guide users on using the file recovery system effectively.
   - Create a final project report summarizing the project's objectives, findings, and lessons learned.

Conclusion:
The development of a file recovery and data restoration system will not only help users retrieve lost or crashed files but also enhance their understanding of file systems, data structures, and various data recovery techniques. This mini cyber security project can serve as a valuable learning experience and potentially aid in real-world data recovery situations.
